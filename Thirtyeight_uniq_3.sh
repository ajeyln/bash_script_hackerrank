#Given a text file, count the number of times each line repeats itself (only consider consecutive repetions). 
#Display the count and the line, separated by a space. There shouldn't be leading or trailing spaces. 
#Please note that the uniq -c command by itself will generate the output in a different format.
#This time, compare consecutive lines in a case insensitive manner. 
#So, if a line X is followed by case variants, the output should count all of them as the same (but display only the form X in the second column).
#So, as you might observe in the case below: aa, AA and Aa are all counted as instances of 'aa'. 
#!/bin/bash
cat name.txt | uniq -ic | tr -s " " | cut -c2-
#i indicates ignoring the case
